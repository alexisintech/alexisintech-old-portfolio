# [Portfolio](https://alexisintech.github.io/)
This website provides quick and easy access to my social media links. I built this as an alternative to a link tree as link tree limits certain links and also, link tree offers limited creative freedom.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript     
With help from and credit to [Ben Scott](https://benscott.dev/)


## Lessons Learned:

This portfolio has been a continuous journey of practicing media queries, animations and transitions, and most importantly, JavaScript!!! While the JavaScript code was written almost entirely by Ben Scott, delving into it to customize it for my portfolio has been a huge learning process and each week that I progress in my bootcamp, I love looking at this portfolio's JS code and recognizing more and more code.
